# Flickr API

A simple photo widget that allows you to display photos from a Flickr feed. Search a user's ID or username to grab results.

Currently if you are going to fork and use this app, you will need to establish environment variables in config/application.yml using [Figaro gem's guidelines](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro). You'll need to have a [Flicker API access key](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/).

Later a production version may be launched on Herkou.
